   <h2><b> Design Studio: Reframing by Reflectings</b></h2>
  <h2><b> 11.01.2022</b></h2>
    
    
      <p>“Each time I  wake up, function in my habits and context, I perpetuate and function in the systems I am fighting for or against.
         Am I living my fight? In honoring what I chose as my fight,
          I am wondering how I can embody these systems in myself, in first person. 
          I am in perfect capacity in making new forms of living, by living as an example. I am an agent of change”</p>
   
          <p>The first week being back from winter holiday, whilst also writing my thesis draft,
             has sparked a lot of motivation for reflection in the projects I did in the first term, 
             and also the interests I express this term, and after the first design studio and Future talks, 
             I am moved to purposefully impact in my local community, and embrace the complexities. When I think 
             of how this visually looks, I think of a systemic galaxy group functioning in various scales inside out, 
             and outside in</p>
   
            <p>What are my interests and Identity now?</p>
   
              <p>The MDEF programme  has offered me a platform to map
                 my strengths and my network to make an impactful contribution to the
                  Weak Signals I care about. Representing my ideas, identity and fight in a
                   design space has been a profoundly introspective journey, where I found myself
                     shifting and growing in my ideas and who I want to be as a designer. </p>
   
                <p>My vision as a designer is to advocate 
                  for social justice in urban spaces using digital frameworks and decentralized web 
                  systems as a tool for research and design.  I want to find my place in understanding the 
                  connections and architectures of decentralized digital systems, machine learning models, 
                  conscious use of new technologies, learning creative coding and soft robotics for design
                   interventions to make an impact on a set community. This trimester I choose to work with 
                    artists and creatives in the digital space.</p>
   
                  <p>Reflection as a design Tool </p>
   
                    <p>Reflection is a way to make implicit knowledge explicit , a way to help us make decisions. This is based on what has been happening. Donald Schon, knowing in action is the way we deploy our action, our tacit knowledge is embedded in our actions.
                        The conversation with the situation and the results you get,
                         are what the situation is reflecting you. But as you change the situation,
                          the situation also changes you. Reflection is reaching a higher level of extraction. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
                        <p>Asking 5 why’s <p>
                          <li> Why did we create a workshop as a collective intervention and how can I move away from a workshop format?</li>
                            <li> Why did I move from volunteering to digital interfaces ? Is this my growth </li>
                              <li> Why was it difficult to find participants for the workshops?</li>
                                <li> Why am I situated here? How  can I be more involved in a small team that is impactful and long lasting past a
                                   one day workshop that is out of context? </li>
                                  <li> Why am I here? What is the next shift from global thinking to a personal project?</li>
   
   <p>  What if? What are alternative ways / wish I did differently  <p>
     <li> if I amalgamated volunteering and digital interfaces, how does this look</li>
      <li> What if I involve myself as the subject of my designs , mixing the personal with my design practice? </li>
        <li> Compare myself with others ( some movements and studios I look up to)</li>
          <li> link to miro eco system here</li>
            <li> What are my takeaways from term I: </li>
   
   <p>Reaching out to organizations and people already involved in “my fight” or with similar interests is a huge leap to understand what I am exploring and start asking the right questions. This example is from after our visit in  Can Batllo and meeting with Clement from Aqui
   Sharing your ideas, realistically where they are, is powerful , I saw this from design dialogues. Even just sharing creates a platform to reflect, and talk to other like minded people, create networks etc
   Unlearn a lot what I learnt in design school ( such as comparing yourself, competitiveness)
   Never do anything alone ( work with others and collaborate with classmates and outside of IAAC)
   Document for yourself and others - be open and show your mistakes, your thoughts and weaknesses. Communicate your process
   Learn to redefine failure, rethink what perfect means- when you see the pictures you see the perfect. 
   Dont let a sense of perfection hinder the development of the project. This can lead with procrastination,
    go with what you have. There is no failure as we are exploring possibilities. Think about the references
     you are using to judge yourself , they can be fading or harmful. What are my strengths? When you are exploring 
     something new, you need to re-assess your reference point of movement, its not always good or bad. How have I learnt? </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Some things to remember for Term II </p>
   
    <li> Getting lost is a way of building a new geography to build a new vocabulary , 
      getting geographical referencing, and the capacity to navigate using intuition </li>
   
      <li>Rather than designing from top up, Took time to let the design reveal
         itself by interacting with other people who are interested in the topic and designing within</li>
   
        <li>Sharing a rough process, something in the works , or pictures of the process step, 
          by step, rather than waiting to show a finished polished product </li>
   
          <li>Sharing ideas and working with others is valuable, embracing differences and complexities becomes more holistic</li>
   
            <li>Having a global mindset with a local action- impactul local </li>
