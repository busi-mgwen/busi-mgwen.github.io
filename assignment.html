<p>Gene patents are currently a disputed topic that opens up the question of “what are the ethical limits of modification and owning genes.
   During the introductory theory lessons of Bio Zero, we diverged into the discourse of  the right of all humans to have access to open scientific knowledge and shareable content.  After the theory class, I developed  speculations on the ownership of genes that we all share as human beings and what the future of the accessibility of gene information looks like. In my interests in a future of possible transhumanism and gene augmentation, in a fair and equal manner,  In this summary, I wanted to better understand the current milieu of human gene patenting as an invention and intellectual property by studying the article titled “Intellectual Property Landscape of the Human Genome”.
</p>




<ul>

  <li>The category with the most patents in the human genome include those claiming human protein encoding nucleotide sequences (biomolecules forming alleles within a DNA or RNA molecule represented by the 5th and 3rd end of the order sequence) </li>

  <li>Critics of gene patenting describe it as a “land grab” that would significantly impair future research of medicine, academics and investment on these genes. </li>

  <li>Counter arguments claim that intellectual property incentivises crucial investment opportunities and vibrant markets. </li>

  <li>The article exhibits a detailed map of gene patent activity on chromosome 20 using bioinformatics methods to show claims of nucleotide sequence claims in the USA. </li>


  <li>The map shows intellectual property rights in physical locations in the chromosome that claim specific sequences. </li>

  <li>The article study shows that 20% of human genes are claimed as intellectual property, which is 4382 out of 23 688 genes.The genes are owned by 1156 different entities, where most are based in the USA. </li>

  <li>Not all areas of the human genome are patented, most patented genes are for diagnostic purposes, yet some regions in the human genome have hot spots. </li>

  <li>Some examples of patented genes are BMP7 proteins, used for implants to stimulate bone growth and BRCA1 for breast cancer research. </li>

  <li>In conclusion, the article suggests further areas for research such as examining whether current  practices have allowed overlapping and conflicts in the same gene. </li>

  <li>The article mostly framed the study on protein-coding genes, further studies are encouraged in the intellectual property of non-protein human genome factors such as RNA and ribozymes. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Assignment 2: From Invader to Superfood: Genome editing of the pittosporum tobira using CRISPR/ Cas9 and phytobricks</h3>

<p> This project proposes the design of a new protein sequence, introducing the Leucine amino acid found in spirulina, replacing Saponin synthesis found in pittosporum tobira. The purpose of this synthetic engineering is to modify the invasive plant species into an edible superfood growing in the urban parks of Barcelona.The strategy is based off the HYPE-IT iGEM competition entry, where  a split Cas9 variant is introduced into plants, to make gene knock-outs, leading in new enhanced plant varieties.</p>

<p>Pittosporum tobira ( Japanese Cheesewood) is found in  many urban parks and gardens as an invasive plant species in Barcelona.  Pittosporum tobira can be found in 68% of parks and gardens according to the Estudi d’espècies invasores a la ciutat de Barcelona.  pittosporum tobira is native to China and Japan yet it is planted in Barcelona, it spores itself throughout the whole area until the whole property becomes a wilderness. Albeit, it is used in most landscaping as a resistant hedge or shelter bed plantings.

Furthermore the plant contains saponins- a class of glycoside which when absorbed poorly by humans and animals can become toxic.
The saponins are hydrophylic water soluble sugars attached to lipophilic steroids and generally have a soap-like pungent taste. (Hofmann et al., 2003)

pittosporum tobira  does not have any nutritional benefits.
The proposal of this project is to introduce the glycoside sugar functional group as leucine found in spirulina  genetically modified to inhibit Saponins.


Methodology: Using Phytobricks and split Cas9 Parts


Description of CRISPR/ Cas9
CRISPR/ Cas9 is a  genetic engineering technique where the genomes of living organisms may be modified. By delivering a synthetic enzyme that recognizes and cleaves to specific strands of DNA, the synthetic guide RNA (gRNA)  can be delivered into a cell, allowing new genes to be added in the nucleotide sequences.

Design steps of the Gene sequence to be edited
<ul>
<li>Saponins have a  H-bonding hydrophobic affinity and contain a toxic substance or metabolic stimulant while leucine is a carboxylic acid group, using CRISPR/ Cas9, the saponins will be replaced by the leucine amino acid group.

<li>Phytobricks are Standard parts in the plant synthetic biology.</li>
   In this genome editing project, existing phyto brick chassis will be used including the designing of new phyto bricks using Cas9 endonuclease building a genetic circuit and  the synthetic leucine gene. (gRNA)</li>
<li>The new leucine gRNA parts created will be based on split-cas9  in pUPD2, so they can be inserted in the adapted viral vector of choice, using Phytobricks overhangs.</li>
<li>Finally, In the genetic protein coding sequence of th the new gRNA molecules, every three nucleotides of the new coding sequence will be manipulated to introduce a new leucine amino acid. </li>
  The trinucleotide sequence of the plant’s DNA describes the relationship between the DNA bases ( A,C,G and T) where the  last sequence will be optimized with a glycoside sugar functional group. </li>
</ul>

The nucleotide sequence of the saponin gene found in Pittosporum tobira will be replaced with the sequence of the leucine amino acid using phytobricks and CRISPR/ Cas9  in the correct, corresponding sequencing position.
