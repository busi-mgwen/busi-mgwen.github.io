  <h2><b> Term 2:Introduction to Future Talks</b></h2>
  <h2><b> 10.01.2022</b></h2>
    


  <p> How can I apply for the Future Talks seminars? </p>
  <p>After being back from the holidays, we gathered as a class to reflect that the previous 
semester was about exploring and positioning ourselves and the group interventions and what resonates with me. 
The faculty of the design studio encouraged us to deepen within the context of the community I would like to work in
 and use the Future Talks seminars as a reflection and inspiration to who I want to be in the future. This blog post
  summaries and notes the main takeaways of each Future Talks class, listing how I want to apply the talk in my design practice, 
  drawings and the five Fs of active reviewing by The University of Edinburgh. ( Facts, Feelings, Findings, Future)

  <p> What is Authoethnography?</p>

    <p>It is a Computation with physical forms and interfaces (interaction design) using design to interrogate systems - 
      designing to articulate questions to propose alternative A social science branch using first person methods,
       designing for yourself drawing design research drawing on extensive genuine usage Acknowledges and accommodates 
       emotions and researcher’s influence, not hiding the researcher’s bias not assuming it doesn’t exist. We should not
        assume that or objectivity does not existWhat are tools for autoethnography for designers?</p>

        <p>Tools should pool apart and create a thick personal and interpersonal experiences Fairness 
can also link to ethics, we make assumptions as designers, and with autoethnography we give way 
to understand what works and what does not through your own usage.</p>


<p>How does Autoethnographic design look like?</p>

<p>Applying this in my MDEF journey and my personal design process,
 Audrey helped us understand this has to have the genuine needs to design it for yourself , process of methodological 
 approach thinking what data can I collect? - IT IS A SLOW ONGOING PROCESS, where you have a dance between the object 
 shaping you and you shaping the object. Consistently working, growing uniqueness. Thinking about the dance between 
 designing for specific people and embracing complexity, constantly adapting and growing.</p>


 <p>Here are tools to document autoethnography:</p>

 <li> Tutorials</li>
<li>Photos of the build</li>
<li>Timelapse videos</li>
<li>A diary</li>
<p> Research through Design : How to archive and and document RtD The act of research in comparing
 and contrasting research done on yourself with others Archive of details to make sense of the utility you have. 
 Through Social Media Unstaged photos, take many many photos Taking Notes and listing helps with debugging so you know exactly what's going on A legend /
  diary that you make that's fun and easy Internet of things, multiple roles and reporting Retrospective
   accounts with documenting the on-going Feelings I would like to apply to my design practise: Check in with 
   yourself and others Set a time-frame but also be flexible (things happen) Commit to documenting, choose a form you enjoy, 
   and find a way for dialogical exchange (what do you keep personal, hat do you share) You will wear many hats, 
   Find co-conspirators and talk to others Our bodies are our research instruments ( positionality, etc) </p>
