            <h3> Biology as Information Transmission</h3>
<p>Language is information transmission, cellular communication is the language of the building blocks of life beginning from mini cellular beings, to multicellular organisms. The Biology zero week started with the introduction of information transmission of organisms, starting from quantum mechanics, chemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, cellular biology and physiology. During the very first morning session, I dove right into a new world of  tiny mini-machines in my body and around me. Through the theory of human consciousness, gene modification and the ethics of genetic engineering, I learned that  biology and genes, additionally to being a spelling/ language to sequence the building blocks of cells, also manifests questions of what makes , ethics and the democratization of information access and patents.
</p>

<p><b>Notes on Synthetic biology and the anthropocene </b></p>

<ul>

<li> What should humans be allowed to modify? </li>
<li> Science should have open knowledge and open access. Hackable and shareable. </li>
<li> Speculations and Ideas on the genes we all share can be modified and cause inequality for those who cannot afford modifying themselves. Is this the biological singularity. </li>
<li> What does future planetary well being look like? The human population and macro cities are in a crisis. Our optimising of food, the elements, and nature have created new calamities where designers need to plan locally and think globally to action solutions. </li>
</ul>

<p><b> Realms of Evolution: nature is the best designer </b></p>


<p> I learned that evolution is the machine for creating and that the constraints of growing melti-cellular beings make the parameters for evolution.
   Optimum design is the cycle of evolutions selective pressure.
   Evolution Is the genetic algorithm of generations of successful traits and iterative design. </p>

<p><b> Expected learnings from the Seminar. </b></p>
<ul>
<li> Self reflective activations: Reflections of what I have around me, new augmented reality/ context, where I can position myself. What do I have around me? </li>
<li> Updating my design space with drawings and idea of my capsule. </li>
<li> Close contact with your surroundings, be extreme with my actions and speculations, the output will talk louder ( take a walk and immerse yourself in the speclations. </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Bio-Hacking Practical: Growing bacteria in medium </b></p>

<p> After learning about unicellular organisms, we prepared mediums to grow bacteria as a method to check and test microbes. We grew microbes after understanding the organisms they eat and metabolise.
Other ways of classifying and studying organisms include information management ( eukaryote or prokaryote ), by kingdom, the colony shape ( gram positive or gram negative), sequencing and comparing bacteria communities.</p>


<p><b> Biological Terms I learnt </b></p>

<ul>
<li> Phenotype- The physical properties and morphology of an organism. The genotype is the complete  set of genes of an organism, also referring to its alleles and variant forms. </li>
<li> Metaheuristic -  high-level procedure to find and generate a sufficiently good solution to an optimization problemVoronoi pattern: every point within a given region is closer to the “seed” inside that region than it is to any other point outside that region. </li>
<li> Metabolism- All biochemical processes and reactions in two ways: anabolism which is a bond-making process that requires ATP and catabolism, the bond breaking process. </li>
<li> Enzyme-  A substance that acts as a catalyst in living organisms, regulating the rate at which chemical reactions proceed without itself being altered in the process. The biological processes that occur within all living organisms are chemical reactions, and most are regulated by enzymes. </li>
<li> Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino and carboxyl functional groups, along with a side chain specific to each amino acid. </li>

</ul>

<h3> Agri-forestry and alternative farming</h3>

<p>In the second week, we were introduced to new agroforestry methods, bee keeping and polycultures. We gained skills in soil analysing and understanding that the future of growing food could be computational.
  During the afternoons of the seminar, the MDEF class room transformed into a lab.</p>
  The  practicals included:
  <ul>
        <li> Growing microorganism bacteria  in different mediums we prepared in class. </li>
        <li> Endosymbiotic Bacteria: Preparing solutions to grow spirulina and  kombucha SCOBY. </li>
        <li> Soil sampling testing. </li>
        <li> Distilling and making essential oils. </li>
</ul>
