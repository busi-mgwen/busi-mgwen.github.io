  <h2><b>Week 10-13: Embedded Programming </b></h2>
  
  

  <p>Task: You remember when you had to DESIGN A PCB for week 6? “design a pcb for an input or an output”
     now it is time to fabricate it ( finish the design - mill it - solder it) </p>

     <p>After the Easter holidays, we continued with the topics of input and output devices
My biggest take aways from the input and output classes is that input devices are a way of sensing. 
Since this was a new topic to me, I tried to do intensive note taking to understand the world of sensors</p>

<p>Why do we use sensors?</p>

<p>We use sensors to monitor and control environments. Anything that effects the system, can be captured as data. A physical phenomena is always translated into voltage. We measure and transcribe voltage from physical phenomena into 1s and 0s into data.
The two types of sensors I learnt about were:</p>

<p>A one dimensional sensor, being A sensor giving 1 information such as temperature, showing a time stamp
Capacitative sensor- using touching as a way to make music. We can use low cost sensors to make high impact sensors.</p>
 
<p> Some notes when designing input and output devices:</p>

   <li> Think about where is the energy coming from, where is the power coming from, who is providing the sensor</li>
    <li>Think about where the data is stored, does the power com from batteries etc</li>
      <li> Think about computing power, if you are using video. Is the data stored in a SD card? If you want to store data, 
        you have to think where data is going to go</li>
        <li>Think about if your sensor and your Arduino both work at 5V. Analogue: ADC, Digital:Level shifter, always.</li>
          <li>Simpler is better!</li>
            <li>Look for existing Solutions! </li>

            <p>or the assignment, I was a bit lost on how to make my PCB, designed in week 6 into a functioning artefact. In that case, I decided to make a very simple design to understand the fundamentals.
              On the previous project, I worked on KiCAD to make a PCB that has a button to light up an LED.
               For this assignment I designed an attachment to the Arduino Feather, which is a button (Input devices) 
               that triggers LED light to flash.</p>

               <p>Milling the PCB</p>

               <p>To start off, I exported the KiCAD schematic into Illustrator, separated the layers for the milling process. 
                  I followed and read the milling process from <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2019/docs/FabAcademy-Tutorials/week04_electronic_production/srm20_windows.htm">link text</a> here.</p>
                   
                  <p> After setting up the file on MOD here is the process of milling the PCB:</p>
                  <li> Insert the copper board carefully, and tape it with double sided tape</li>
                    <li> Once the board is inserted, set the origin making sure it touches the material </li>
                      <li> Make sure you have 1000pp for precision</li>
                      <li>Find zero for x, y, and z. Set settings on the computer to mill then send to Modela.</li>
                        <li>Mill the PCB </li>
                          <li>Remove board, cut out if desired, cut apart any areas that didn’t make it.</li>
                            <li>After its done milling, move the machine in the Z direction and remove the board. </li>
                                <li> Finally, solder the components to your freshly made board! </li>

                                <p> Input Task</p>

                                <p>As an input I decided to have a button that triggers an LED to switch on.
                                   After milling, the next task is to solder the resistor, button and pins. The code for Arduino was a 
                                   basic button configuration as follows. </p>

                                   <p>Conclusion and struggles:</p>
