  <h2><b>Week 6:Electronics Design </b></h2>
  

  <p>Milling a PCB </p>
  <p>This week we focused on PCB ( printed circuit board) manufacturing, PCBs are good for preventing short circuits and are a good way for milling non toxic materials. The PCB is a milled sheet of copper that has pads and signal trace structures from a digital circuit board, also known as a a lay out file. In the Fab Lab Barcelona facilities, we have access to the The Roland monoFab SRM-20 
    Most common materials used for milling are phenolic resin, epoxy resin, and polyester resin. We learnt how to solder a line for LED lights on a pre-cut PCB board. 
    Soldering a PCB Board. Soldering is a process in which two or more items are joined together by melting and putting a filler metal into the joint, 
    the filler metal having a lower melting point than the adjoining metal. </p>
 

 
    <p> How to solder: </p>
    <li> Clean the soldering surface </li>
      <li> Turn on the soldering iron and set the melting point of the solder</li>
        <li> Hold the tip of the  leand and contact point</li>
          <li> Touch the solder wire to the contact pint until it flows around the lead</li>
            <li> Make sure there is coverage of the contact area, forming a slight pyramid shape</li>

 <h3>Steps I followed to design the PCB</h3>
 
 
 <li>Step 1: Firstly, I drew the schematic for a button and led Light. I First thought I would 
   like to use a capacitative sensor, with the help of a classmate I drew the schematic, but I decided not to use it at the end.  </li>
   <p><img src="images/pcb2.jpg" width="auto" height="500"> 
 
  <li> Step 2: After drawing the schematic, I saved the file with a .net extension and opened 
    it in the PCBnew file as a netlist file. There I arranged the components neatly, set the track sizes,
     drew the route tracks and then the edge cuts. </li>

    <li>Step 3: The file was then exported to Illustrator, where I configured the line sizes,
       then also saved it as a PNG file ready to be milled on LAB LIFE day </li>

  <p>This weekâ€™s assignment was around computer aided cutting, mostly centered around lazer cutting and vinyl cutting. The project I sought to do was to make fidgeting toys and accessories
    For adults dealing with obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) and body-focused (BFRB) repetitive behavior
     ( such as nail biting, hair pulling and fidgeting).  The idea is  to 3D print artifacts that are aesthetically pleasing and look like sculptures, that can be placed in the home, office table or school, easily accessible for the user when they have bodily focused  urges. The shape of the artifacts resemble the Nigerian language Nsibi. The collection of artifacts resemble a few speech, love and unity.
