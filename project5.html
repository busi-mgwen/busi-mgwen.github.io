<p><b> What is this seminar about? </b></p>
<p>Kick starting the seminar, we were informed that we are going to externalise our ideas and make sense of things as we do them.
   Rather than thinking then becoming, we do rapid actioning, then reflect on our speculative makings.
   Releasing ideas as  prototypes gives way for more ideas and learning. The bottom up approach allows me to explore what kind of ideas transpire, moving away from brain thinking and using the  tools I have around me to take action  using my constituency and ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Recap on what I have learnt in the design studio </b></p>

<ul>

<li> Explore alternatives on the here and now, using low fidelity explorations. </li>
<li> Speculative designs we will make will plant seeds of designing for the future.</li>
<li> FPP is designing within the socio-technical system, shifting the approach from outside in, from designing inside out, this creates the optimum impact as in the design. </li>
<li> FPP is a way of experience and a way of seeing the limitations and constraints, it's a way of being involved outside of seeing people just as numbers or averages. </li>
<li> Systems thinking helps us map possibilities. FPP allows us to rethink the design space and introduce realistic advances influenced by our prototypes. FPP evokes responsible design. </li>

</ul>

<p><b> Using myself as a design tool</b></p>


<p> The FPP is not seen as hypothesis proofing, rather getting involved in the process and becoming an expert through generative performance.
We create a set of possibilities by iterating different, multiple topics.
The series of activities can show multiple learnings where many speculations come up in a constant stream of learning.
Thinking to solve problems NOW, I am needed to involve other people, expand my set of possibilities where collaboration is a REQUIREMENT.</p>

<p><b> Expected learnings from the Seminar. </b></p>
<ul>
<li> Self reflective activations: Reflections of what I have around me, new augmented reality/ context, where I can position myself. What do I have around me? </li>
<li> Updating my design space with drawings and idea of my capsule. </li>
<li> Close contact with your surroundings, be extreme with my actions and speculations, the output will talk louder ( take a walk and immerse yourself in the speclations. </li>

</ul>

<p><b> Kristina Anderason Notes: Making creative collaborations. </b></p>

<p> <i>“ what is complex for our brains, is doable with our bodies, our bodies is our way of understanding complexities.” </i><p>

<p> Industrial design way of thinking “What else can the machine do” - everything can be a machine. When we design something we have a sense of the one use for it, yet once we put it in the world and question more uses, we can rethink the future of industry and making. We can start thinking design as an orchestrator of situated knowledge of my surroundings. Starting situated knowledge starts by thinking of myself as designing for my lived experience. In this way, designing for myself might work for other people as well. </p>

<p><b> Do machines have other uses?</b></p>
<p> Use creativity allowing for strangeness and improvisation, looking for interventions that are outside
Use “magic” as a driver to imagine ideas we have not thought of yet. This magic can be physical manifestations of desire of designs we want
Using machines that work, offer no reflections, and sameness
Design dreams of abstract and difficultness and still make things in this trying world. Design dreams of opposition

<p><b> Creative collaborations with complex systems</b></p>

Challenging the edge capabilities, questioning the corpus. We don't have to allow perfection all the time
Who are we collaborating with and taking in account that we are not designing in an island. “Where are the other places”  you make a machine to make something but we should be conscious what else is turning out as the data
How does the material act when it is collected? Hwo do we deal with justice and equality



<h3> My Magical Machine: The Human Feeder <h3>

<p> The installation is placed in the city where new residents and migrants can participate in putting and voting how their districts can be made better and inclusive. The feeder is also a  bird feeder to habilitate the local ecosystem while also having a compartment for gifts that people can take freely and use at home. I am interested int the interests and needs of those who just arrived in spaces, informing experts for collaborative design. Giving out a gift as seeds, food, invitation to a neighbourhood barbeque is my way of enquiry and collaboration. The feeder is written welcome in several languages to acknowledge diaspora groups and inclusivity of different cultures within the community. </p></h3>

<p><b>  Reflection and feedback on our group magical machine. </b></p>
<p> Everytime you speak about the prototype it generated new speculations.
Our group’s joint work spoke of environments for meeting , where events may or may not happen. We share ideas on different perceptions and perspectives.
The ideations are cyclical and iterative. This is a tool of magical machine making is a means to know more about my group and myself.
Every creative cycle and project is situated. I can tune ideations with the material you have around me.
The materials and your projections foster the process of making and actions. This shapes your objects and the action of designing creates knowledge and exploration ideations.
